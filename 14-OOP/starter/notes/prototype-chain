# Prototype chain

Every object in JavaScript has a prototype!

The prototype of an object created using a constructor function therefore ALSO has a prototype. This prototype is Object.prototype which points to the Object constructor function. The Object constructor function is the 'default/top-level' constructor that is also invoked when we create object literals in JS.

We can think of the prototype chain similarly to the scope chain.
JavaScript attempts to find the method that we have invoked in the object itself, if it is not there, it will continue to 'go-up' the prototype chain until it finds that method.

Object.prototype

        ^

Person.prototype

        ^

jonas{} (object created using Person constructor function)
