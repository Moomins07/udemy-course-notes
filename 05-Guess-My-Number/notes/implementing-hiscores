To impletement the highscore, we first needed to find where in our code that we would add the highscore functionality.

The highscore will update whenever the user wins, so we first know that the functionality should be inside of the if block wherein the user wins.

Then we need to add another if statement as we only want highscore to update when score > highscore.

if (score > highscore) {
highscore = score;
}

If score is greater than highscore: highscore = score.
