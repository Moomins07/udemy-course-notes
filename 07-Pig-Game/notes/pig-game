In this lecture I will be coding the logic to another basic game.

The game will be played by 2 players wherein the user can click 'roll dice' to add 2-6 to a current score. IF the user rolls a 1, their current score is reset.
If the user does not roll a 1 and clicks hold, the current score is added to a total score. The first user to 100 or above wins.

There are 2 ways to select an ID element:

const score0 = document.querySelector("#score--0");
const score1 = document.getElementById("score--1");

If we use querySelector, we must use # at the beginning of the element name. However, if we use getElementById, we have already declared that we are looking for an ID, and so therefore we do not have to use a # to let JS know it is an ID.

To start with, as usual, we create several variables to store element selections such as:

const diceEl = document.querySelector(".dice");

Once that was done, I changed the starting condition of the game as the scores were not set to 0 and a dice image was being displayed for no reason.

To remove the dice image, I created a CSS style with the class of hidden that simply used:
display: none.

I then used diceEl.classList.add("hidden");
to add that hidden class to the image of the dice.
