Again, as usual, we start by adding an element selections I may need to variables at the top of the script with the others.

This time around, I've begun to comment on my code more frequently whilst also using a flow-chart to break the game down into smaller sub-problems.

To start with, I want to generate the dice-roll:

// Rolling dice functionality

btnRoll.addEventListener("click", function () {
// 1. Generating a random dice roll

const dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() \* 6) + 1;

// 2. Display dice

diceEl.classList.remove("hidden");
diceEl.src = `dice-${dice}.png`;

// 3. Check for rolled 1: if true, switch to next player.
});

As you can see, I have broken the function into 3 steps of code that I'd like executed upon the Roll Dice button being clicked.

Step 1: Generate random number.
Step 2: Display that Dice number.
Step 3: Roll conditions.

Firstly, Math.random was used to generate a number between 1 and 6.

Secondly, I remove the hidden class from the dice img, followed by using the src attribute and a template literal to change the dice image that is displayed.

diceEl.classList.remove("hidden");
diceEl.src = `dice-${dice}.png`;

The dice images are numbered from 1-6. Our random number is stored in the 'dice' variable.

By using a template literal, we can manipulate the src attribute and display the correct dice image from 1-6.

If the random number is 2:

`dice-${dice}.png`;

Would be 'dice-2.png' and so the roll of 2 dice image is displayed.
