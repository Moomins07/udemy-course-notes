A value in Javascript is essentially the information that is stored.
For example, a variable is a box with a name on it â€” the value is what you find inside that box. JavaScript has various types of values such as numbers, booleans, strings, objects and functions.

A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of sentence. Metaphorically, we can think of a variable as a labelled box that contains certain 'items'.

E.g. aContainer = 'A string of text.'
