Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

Important to note that grouping (paranthesis) will always be of highest precedence and will run first.

E.g. const averageAge = 46 + 19 / 2 

The above will not give the correct result as 
division '/' has a higher precedence than addition '+'. Therefore it will divide FIRST and THEN addition.

We can correct this by using paranthesis to greaten the precedence. 

E.g const averageAge = (46 + 19) / 2 

46 + 19 will now run first as it is within paranthesis, followed by divide by 2.
