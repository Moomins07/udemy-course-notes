What is a software bug?

A software bug is a defect or a problem in a computer program. Essentially, anything unexpected or unintended behaviour a computer program is a software bug..

Fun note: A real bug caused errors in Harvard's computer in the 1940s, hence the name.

Bugs are completly normal in software development. We are human afterall.

Debugging is the process of finding, fixing and preventing futher bugs.

Step 1: IDENTIFY // Becoming aware that there is a bug.
- During development
- Testing software
- User reports during production
- Context, browsers, users etc.

Step 2: FIND // Isolating where exactly the bug is occurring in the code.
- Developer console (simple code)
- Debugger (complex code)

Step 3: FIX // Correct the bug.
- Replace the wrong solution with new correct solution.

Step 4: PREVENT // Preventing it from happening again.
- Searching for the same bug in similar code.
- Writing tests using testing software.
