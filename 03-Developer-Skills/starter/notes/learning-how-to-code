In this lecture, I will learn about the actual process of learning how to code as a complete beginner.

--------------------------------------------------
How to fail at learning how to code! 
--------------------------------------------------

1. Not having a clear goal at the beginning of our coding journey.

2. Copying code without caring for how it works. Aka Copy pasting.

3. Not reinforcing what I am learning by completing small       challenges or taking notes.

4. Not practicing coding outside of the courses or coming up with my own project ideas.

5. Quickly becoming frustrated when my code is not clean or efficient.

6. Losing motivating by thinking that I could never know enough/everything.

7. Learning in isolation without sharing my process.

8. After finishing a couple of courses, thinking that I'm now a web developer and that I can start applying to jobs, but I'm not able to build an app on my own.


--------------------------------------------------
How to succeed at learning how to code! FIXES!
--------------------------------------------------

1.

Set a specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goal:
-------------------------------------------------------------
I want to be a front-end web developer by 2023.

Know exactly why I am learning to code:
---------------------------------------
To begin a career in a field that's always interested me/with great opportunity, to be able to provide more for my family financially.

Imagine a big project you want to be able to build:
---------------------------------------------------
Probably something OSRS related, or potentially Unity related later down the line.

Research technologies you need and then learn them:
---------------------------------------------------
React seems to be the most talked about.



2.

Understand the code that you are studying and typing.

Always type the code, don't copy paste!



3.

After learning a new feature or concept, use it immediately.

Take notes.

Challenge yourself and practice small coding exercises and challenges.

Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast.



4.

Practicing on your own is the most important thing to do.

This is NOT optional. Without practice outside of courses, you won't go anywhere.

Come up with your own project ideas op copy popular sites of applications, or just parts of them in the beginning.

Don't get stuck in 'tutorial hell'.



5.

Don't get stuck trying to write perfect code.

Just write tons of code, no matter the quality.

Clean and efficient code will come with time.

You can always refactor code later.



6.

Embrace the fact that you will never know everything about web development.

Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal.



7.

Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it, you truly understand it.

Share your goals to make yourself accountable.

Share your learning progress with the web dev community. #100DaysofCode etc.



8.

This is the biggest misconception that people have.

Courses are an amazing foundation, but are only the beginning of your journey.
