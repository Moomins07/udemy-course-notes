const measureKelvin = function () {
  const measurement = {
    type: 'temperature',
    unit: 'celsius',

    // Step 3: FIX
    value: Number(prompt('Degrees celsius:')),
  };

  // Step 2: FIND
  console.log(measurement);

  //console.log(measurement.value);
  const kelvin = measurement.value + 273;
  return kelvin;
};

// Step 1: IDENTIFY
console.log(measureKelvin());


The focus of this lecture is to use the console/breakpoints to resolve any bugs that may occur in our code. 

Above, we have created a basic function called measureKelvin that includes an object called 'measurement', that holds 3 key value pairs. type, unit and value.

The property of 'value' is determined by the user's input/prompt.
Following this, we create a variable called kelvin that calculates the user's input in the object + 273 to calculate the kelvin temperature.

Upon using console.log(measurement), we found that the prompt is accepting the user input as a string, not a number. Therefore our kelvin function is adding a string to 273.

E.g. 10 + 273 = 10273. Not 283.

We know that it is the value property in our measurement object that is accepting prompt inputs as a string, to we fix this simply using the Number method. All input is now converted to a number.

NOTE// console.table can also be used to neatly display an object.
