Boolean logic is a branch of computer science which uses true and false values to solve complex logical problems. To do that, it uses several logical operators to combine truth and false values.

We will cover the 3 basic boolean operators. AND (&&) OR (||) 

Boolean logic is not specific to JS, it is used in all programming. 

The AND (&&) operator will only return true if ALL values return true.  If any value is false, the AND operator will return false.

The OR (||) operator will return true if at least one value is true. This is also the case with several values. If all values are false, the OR operator will return false.

The NOT (!) operator only acts on one boolean value and it basically just inverts it. If 'A' is true, it will become false. If it is false, NOT A will become true. 

E.g.

const age = 16;

A: age is >= 20 (false)
B: age is < than 30 (true)

!A (NOT A) = true (inverts boolean value)

A(false) && B(true) = false

A(false) || B(true) = true

!A(true) && B(true) = true

A(false) || !B(false) = false
