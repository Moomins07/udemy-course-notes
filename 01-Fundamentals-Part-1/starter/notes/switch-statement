A switch statement is an alternative way of writing a complicated if...else statement when all we want to do is compare one value to multiple different options.

Example of switch statement below:

const day = `thursday`;

switch (day) {      
    case `monday`:
        console.log(`Plan course structure.`);
        console.log(`Go to coding meetup.`)
        break;
    case `tuesday`:
    case `wednesday`:
        console.log(`Write code examples.`);
        break;
    default:
        console.log(`Not a valid day!`);
}


If you do not use 'break;' after the code the code that will run if condition is true, the code will continue to run down the switch statement.

You can use multiple 'cases' as the equivalent of an OR || operator. Above, we see that both `tuesday` and `wednesday` will execute: console.log(`Write code examples.`);
`default` is the equivalent of an `else` statement and will run if no other code will.
