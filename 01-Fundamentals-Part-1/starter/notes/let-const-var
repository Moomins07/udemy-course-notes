let

Declaring a variable using 'let' allows that variable to be re-assigned/mutated.
E.g. let x = 'changeme'
         x = 42;
x was assigned the string value of 'changeme',
x was then mutated/reassigned the value of 42, a number. 'let' should only be used if we know that the variable will be reassigned at some point during our program.


const

Declaring a value using const does not allow a variable to be re-assigned of mutated. 'const' should be used by default when we are sure that a variable's value will remain the same throughout our program. This reduces the change of bugs in our code. 

var

'var' is an outdated syntax that was used to declare variables before ES6. It should be avoided as it no longer serves a purpose with the addition of let and const.
