There are 2 types of values in JavaScript.
Objects and Primitive values.

There are 7 primitive data types:
Number,
String,
Boolean,
Null,
Undefined,
BigInt,
Symbol.

Numbers are referred to as floating point numbers, which means they always have decimals even if we don't see them or define them.
E.g. let age = 23; (23.0)

Strings are a sequence of characters and are used for text. Always in quotes.

Boolean is essentially a logical type that can only accept 2 logical values, either true or false. We use boolean values to make decisions. 

Undefined is taken by a variable that is not yet defined. Simply, a variable that has not yet been assigned a value.
E.g. let children; 

Null also means empty value but it is used under different circumstances.

Symbol simply defines a value that is unique and cannot be changed.

BigInt is used for integers that are too large to be represented by the Number type. Essentially, it's another type for numbers.

JavaScript has dynamic typing. We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Data types are determined automatically by JS. Distinction between value and variable is important because in JS, it's the value that has a type, NOT the variable. Variables store values that have a type.
JS also allows us to store a new value of a different data type to the same variable without issue. 
E.g. variable 'x' can be a number and later become a string.


There is a bug in JavaScript that returns the typeof null as an object rather than null.
