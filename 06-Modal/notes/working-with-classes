In this lecture we will learn how to manipulate classes with JavaScript.

We have a <div> in the html document with 2 classes 'modal hidden'.
the class hidden as been specified a display: none in the css styling document meaning that this <div> will stay hidden.

We use JavaScript to remove the class 'hidden' causing the <div> to display on our webpage. We do this by using the classList.remove() method. See below:

for (let i = 0; i < btnsOpenModal.length; i++) {
btnsOpenModal[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
modal.classList.remove("hidden");
});

We created a loop that adds an eventListener 'click' to each show-modal button. Upon being clicked, the class 'hidden' is removed and so the <div> displays.

NOTE:
When specifying which class to add/remove, do not use a dot/fullstop at the beginning of the class name. We only use dots when selecting a class, here we only need to type the name of the class that we are manipulating.
E.g. "hidden" NOT ".hidden"

We re-add the hidden class to our btnCloseModal (X at top right of modal box) to be able to close our modal boxes (re-hiding the modal box/overlay).

btnCloseModal.addEventListener("click", function () {
modal.classList.add("hidden");
overlay.classList.add("hidden");
});

Following this, we want to add the ability to close the modal by clicking outside of the modal-box on the overlay. To do so, we simply repeat the same cose as above but instead applied to 'overlay'.
However, this would be repeating uneccessary code again, so to tackle this we created a function that adds the hidden class to modal and overlay. We then use that function on both btnCloseModal and overlay. See below:

const closeModal = function () {
modal.classList.add("hidden");
overlay.classList.add("hidden");
};

btnCloseModal.addEventListener("click", closeModal);
overlay.addEventListener("click", closeModal);

I also did the same to open the modal too:

const openModal = function () {
modal.classList.remove("hidden");
overlay.classList.remove("hidden");
};

The function is now invoked upon a click event handler to open the modal boxes.
Note that we don't add () when adding the function in the event handler as this would invoke the function straight away, NOT when it is clicked.
